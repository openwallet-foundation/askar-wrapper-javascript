feat: update to Askar 0.5.0 release.

- This adds support for providing a custom Argon2 config.
- In addition it adds methods to list the open sessions and scans on a store. Note however that these methods are only implemented in the Node.JS wrapper for now, they will be added to the React Native wrapper at a later stage.
